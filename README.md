Muons are subatomic particles derived from the nuclear fragmentation of galactic cosmic
rays, which are composed of energetic ions from the Sun. The amount of muon particles
bombarding the Earth is believed to have a significant correlation with certain local weather
factors. The study focuses to determine if the claims are true or false through big data analysis
centralized in Atlanta, Georgia. Excel is used for the processing of seven data sets each
consisting of 69 daysâ€™ worth of points: muon count, temperature, air pressure, wind speed, relative
humidity, dew point, and cloud thickness. MATLAB is used to perform linear regression analysis
of muon count versus each of the six weather factors and to generate over-time and scatter plots.
All regression models show very weak or no correlations between muon count and the different
weather factors, but this is most likely a result of a narrow range of data and unpredictable
Georgia weather.
